Violence Detection System
=========================

This project implements an advanced **real-time surveillance system** that detects violent activities and automatically alerts authorities with crucial information such as the **crime location**, **time**, and **images**. The system uses state-of-the-art **computer vision** techniques and machine learning models to achieve **95% accuracy** in violence detection.

### Key Features:

-   **Real-time Violence Detection**: Detects violent actions in real-time using a custom-trained MobileNetV2 model.
-   **Automated Alerts**: Sends automatic alerts to authorities via Telegram, including relevant crime details (location, time, images).
-   **Optimized for Low-Light Conditions**: Achieved 30% better accuracy in detecting violence in low-light conditions by optimizing the model with **Deep Sort** tracking and advanced computer vision techniques.
-   **Self-Learning Rate Algorithm**: Utilized a custom self-learning rate algorithm, which improved model efficiency by 25%.
-   **AWS Integration**: Gained expertise in AWS and integrated Big Data analytics to streamline real-time data processing, enhancing system response time and scalability.

### Why This System?

Real-time violence detection is essential for improving public safety. By implementing an efficient, scalable solution that can recognize violent actions as they happen, this system offers several advantages:

Usage
-----

1.  **Start the Surveillance System**:

    -   To begin monitoring, use the following command to start the real-time violence detection system:

        bash

        Copy code

        `python main.py --input <video_stream_or_file>`

2.  **Real-Time Alerting**:

    -   When violence is detected, the system will automatically send a message to the authorities' Telegram chat with the crime location, time, and images:

        bash

        Copy code

        `# Message example:
        "Violence detected at [Location] at [Time]. Image attached."`

3.  **Track and Improve the Model**:

    -   The system continuously trains and improves by adapting the model with a self-learning rate, increasing efficiency over time.
